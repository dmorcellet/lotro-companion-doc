# How to install the LotroCompanion plugin

## Get it!
The LotroCompanion plugin can be found:
- at SourceForge: ![here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lotrocompanion/files/lotro-companion-plugin-11.zip/download)

## Install it
Unzip the downloaded ZIP archive into the directory for the LOTRO plugins.  
Usually (i.e on Windows) this is in <user.home>\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins where <user.home> is your home directory (something like c:\Users\yourlogin).  
In the end, you shall have a directory LotroCompanion inside the the Plugins directory. This LotroCompanion directory contains a file called LotroCompanion.plugin, and another directory called LotroCompanion.

## Run
Start the game.  
Use the plugins manager to indicate which characters shall load the plugin automatically on session start.  
This can be done before opening a character session, from the main screen (button "Manage Plugins").  
The plugins manager is also available from a character session, using command:

    /plugins manager

Alternatively, you can use these commands to load/unload the plugin:

    /plugins load LotroCompanion  
    /plugins unload LotroCompanion

## Restrictions
The LotroCompanion plugin has been tested on a Lotro client in English. Its behaviour on non-English client is unknown.
