# A bit of history

## The beginning
It started in 2012 as a character status tracker. At the time, we had the site 'my.lotro.com'. We had also 'data.lotro.com' but I discovered that too late.
This site would give us web pages for:
- character gear (just like the in-game character panel)
- a character log (no equivalent in game). This was a table with dated character 'events': quest completions, deed completions, crafting status changes, level changes.

The initial version of the application would just grab that data from the web, and store it locally for display off-line.
The first 3 versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 were built for that.

Version 1.0 provided:
- a 'main' window with the characters table
- a window for each character to show its gear
- a 'character log' window.
This was equivalent to the online site.

Version 2.0 added:
- crafting status assessment (from character log), displayed in a dedicated window
- reputation status assessment (from character log), displayed in a dedicated window
- a decent color theme

Version 3.0 added:
- levels chart (from character log)
- warbands window (from character log)
- an 'about' window

## End of an era
As you may know, the services used by this application (my.lotro.com) have been stopped by Turbine around 2013.
Overnight, this application became completely useless.

## Rebirth
It took time for me to recover and to find a new use for the existing codebase.
Here I'd like to thank Galuhad, author of the plugins 'Tulkas' and 'Item Treasury' and later Giseldah (see ratings to formula page on lotro-wiki).Those 2 made me think it was possible to build a Magelo-like tool for lotro. They helped me dive deep into the game mechanics.

So there was a rebirth late 2016 and then came version 4.0 at the beginning of 2017. Version 5,6,7 were released in 2017, and then 8,9,10 in 2018.

That is for the history...

So the initial use was a character status tracker. Later it became a character simulation tool. And later it started to provided some lore data (maps, deeds...).
